# photosearch

This is a very simple server.

It has two routes:

/api/latest 

This route will respond with the last ten searches

/api/imagesearch/[your keywords, separated by spaces or +]?offset=[number]

This route will respond with photo data from the pixabay api.

This repo is just for good practice, thanks for checking it out!
